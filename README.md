Plugin works only with Query Builder, so you can break only listings where you get the posts with Query Builder

Also at the moment plugin works only with the Posts. But you can extend it by yourself for any object type you want (details in ths **Advanced** section)

And last note - plugin doesn't sort posts by date itself, it only adding breaks based on comparison of posts dates. So you need to sort post by your self with Query settings

## Setup
- Download and intall plugin,
- Define configuration constants in the end of functions.php file of your active theme,
- Add 'break_months' into Query ID option of Query builder (may be changed with configuration constants):

**Note!** If you using Listing Grid in combination with JetSmartFilters, you need to set 'break_months' also as listing ID and filter query ID
